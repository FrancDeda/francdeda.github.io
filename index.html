            <h3>🌦 Global Weather App</h3>
            <p>
                A weather application that provides a <strong>7-day forecast</strong> for any location in the world.
                This project marked my <strong>first experience using Docker</strong> to containerize and deploy an application.

            <h3>🏥 Health Tracking & AI Diagnosis App</h3>
            <p>
                In this project, I served as the <strong>Scrum Leader</strong> — my first time leading a team. 
                I was responsible for managing tasks, coordinating weekly meetings, and keeping the team on schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app allows patients to create accounts, store past diagnoses, enter symptoms, and receive an <strong>AI-generated diagnosis</strong>. 
                This was also my <strong>first experience designing and working with a local database</strong>.
